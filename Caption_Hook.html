							<h1>Caption Hook</h1>
							
						</header>
						<h2>Motivation</h2>
						<p>In the fifth semester I selected a course called “Advanced Game Programming” to better my understanding on how to implement game systems. 
							For this module we had to create a physics game. Because every team member already had experience with unity decided to increase the scope of the project.
							 I suggested to center the game around a hook mechanic because I think a hook shot makes every game more fun. 
							 The aesthetic of the game is centered around the pun of captain and caption thus the player hooks himself to the whole spectrum of captions 
							 from Instagram to desktop icon captions.

						<h2>My Contribution</h2>
						<p>Because there was more initiative from my group members in this project there was not as much of burden put on me. 
							I implemented the base hook mechanic and the physics used to control the pirate, I also implemented and designed the menu, 
							added a score system in conjunction with a leaderboard which persists through play sessions, a camera scrolling system, 
							procedural placement of collectibles and a scene manager which loads levels on demand and cleans up dependencies. I also did a lot of bug-fixing for this project.

						<h2>Implementation</h2>
						<p>I implemented the base mechanic by using another object with a pivot on a player which is rotated based on the mouse position.
							If the left mouse button is pressed a raycast is shot from the gun object if this raycast hits anything within range the rope of the hook shot is enabled.
							The rope wase created by using a Springjoint2D which binds to objects together and contracts at a certain adjustable distance threshold. 
							The distance can be increased and decreased with the left and right mouse button which simulates the effect of pulling in or descending. Additionally, 
							I also used an animation curve to displace the line segments of an attached line renderer component to add an animation for the rope’s suspension. 
							This approach had the added benefit that the animation and sprite for the rope could be easily replaced and adjusted.
							The menu was implemented by using a state machine design pattern. When I coded menus previously I if statements. 
							this solution is very bad when the game scales and needs more menu screens because each one needs a new if statement and comes with a lot of edge cases. 
							A state machine eliminates these problems by restricting the menu to be in only one state which can only go to selected states 
							and thus eliminating a lot of undefined behavior. I defined an interface for the state machine and states, which required overloading 
							the OnEnter and OnExit functions. By requiring this functionality through an interface, the state machine can execute functionality when changing states 
							like for example hiding and showing menu screens in a menu state machine. The state machine itself just uses a dictionary with Enums for the states to change between them.
							Each transition is added before program execution.
							A lot more boilerplate code is required for this implementation, but the benefits are clear when menus with a lot of screens are needed.
							To implement the score, I added a timer class to track the time using a coroutine. When finishing the level, 
							the amount of collected coins are subtracted and the final score is calculated and displayed. 
							The player can choose to enter his name with an input field and afterwards the score is displayed in a row with the top ten scores. 
							To implement the score display I once again used layout groups and prefabs for each score row. Up to ten can be displayed and they grow smaller the more exist. 
							The score is also persistent through play sessions by using saving the name and score together with the place on the scoreboard in playerprefs. 
							using this solution is very easy because the file I/O is already taken care of. For larger projects where a lot of data must be these scales badly, 
							and I would choose to do my own I/O using something like a JSON format to save. However, 
							for only small amounts of data this fine and saves the hassle of worrying about error handling.
							lastly to resolve dependencies we used a lot of events. This had the added benefit of keeping in line with the singe responsibly paradigm
							and additionally requires less Null handling. Modelling dependencies through events has a lot of benefits for games.
