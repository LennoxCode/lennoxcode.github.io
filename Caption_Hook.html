						<h2>Motivation</h2>
						<p>
							In the fifth semester, I enrolled in the 'Advanced Game Programming' course to further  enhance my gameplay programming skills and deepen my understanding of scalable software patterns. The module required us to develop a physics-based game. Building on the team's prior Unity experience, we sought to expand the project's scope. I proposed focusing on a hook mechanic, as I believe a hook shot adds an element of fun to any game. The primary objective was to craft a compelling central gameplay mechanic that, when harmoniously integrated with level design, could yield interesting levels with escalating difficulty. The game's aesthetic revolves around a playful play on words, merging the concepts of 'captain' and 'caption.' Consequently, players hook themselves to a variety of captions, spanning from Instagram to desktop icon captions.

						<h2>My Contribution</h2>
						<p>
							Due to increased initiative from my group members, the project workload was well-distributed. I took charge of implementing pivotal elements such as the base hook mechanic and the physics governing the pirate's movements. Additionally, I designed and implemented the menu, integrated a score system with a persistent leaderboard, established a camera scrolling system, enabled procedural placement of collectibles, and engineered a scene manager for dynamic level loading. Bug-fixing also fell within my responsibilities, ensuring the project's smooth functionality.

						<h2>Implementation</h2>
						<p>
							I implemented the foundational mechanics by employing an object with a pivot on the player, rotated based on mouse position. Upon left mouse button press, a raycast is emitted from the gun object. If the ray hits anything within range, the hook shot's rope is enabled. The rope, created using a SpringJoint2D, which binds objects together and contracts at an adjustable distance threshold. This distance is manipulated with the left and right mouse buttons to simulate the effect of pulling in or descending. Additionally, I utilized an animation curve to displace line segments of an attached LineRenderer component, introducing an animation for the rope's suspension. This approach facilitates easy replacement and adjustment of the animation and sprite for the rope.
							<br>
							<br>
							The menu system was implemented using a state machine design pattern. Compared to the previous use of if statements in menu coding, this solution eliminates scalability issues associated with an increasing number of menu screens. A state machine confines the menu to a single state that can only transition to selected states, reducing undefined behavior. I established an interface for the state machine and states, necessitating overloading of the OnEnter and OnExit functions. Enforcing this functionality through an interface enables the state machine to execute actions when changing states, such as hiding and showing menu screens. The state machine itself utilizes a dictionary with Enums for states, with each transition defined before program execution. Despite the increased boilerplate code, the benefits become evident when dealing with menus containing numerous screens.
							<br>
							<br>
							To manage scoring, I introduced a timer class using a coroutine to track time. Upon completing a level, the collected coins are tallied, and the final score is calculated and displayed. Players can input their names through an input field, and the scores are showcased in rows featuring the top ten scores. I employed layout groups and prefabs for score rows, ensuring a dynamic and space-efficient display. Persistent score data is maintained through play sessions via saving the name, score, and place on the scoreboard in PlayerPrefs. While this solution is suitable for small-scale data management, larger projects may warrant custom I/O, such as using a JSON format, to handle increased data complexity. Lastly, to address dependencies, an events-based system was implemented. This not only aligns with the single responsibility paradigm but also minimizes null handling. Leveraging events for modeling dependencies offers several advantages in game development.
							<br>
							<br>
							In conclusion, the strategic application of software patterns and adherence to clean code principles, such as the implementation of events and the state machine, proved instrumental in streamlining the development process of the game. These practices not only fortified the project against scalability challenges but also allowed for the incorporation of a more extensive scope.
