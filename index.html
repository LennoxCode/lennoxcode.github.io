								<h3>Number classification Neural Network 
								</h3>
								<p>In the fifth semester I selected a machine learning course. In preparation I decided to implement a neural network from scratch in my spare time
									 by only using python and the NumPy library for the required matrix multiplication. 
									 I used the MNIST dataset for training and after training the network boasts an accuracy of 97% for the test set.
