							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Hey, I am Leonard Valentin. I am a 22-year-old computer science student from Berlin 
							and currently enrolled in my fifth semester at the HTW and looking to finish my degree after my internship. 
							My main interest in study are game engines, AI, software design, image detection algorithms and backend programming.
							I am currently looking for an internship as part of my curriculum and to further enhance my knowledge. During my studies so far,
							I completed several projects for course work and also extra-curricular which I want to showcase on this website. 
						</p>

								<h3>StudyPlan Web App</h3>
								<p>StudyPlan is an online tool which aims to help students plan out their study and tries to solve the Problem of course distribution
									by implementing a priority system so people have a higher chance of getting into courses which interest them more. 
									The final app got deployed and used this semester to assign courses.

								<h3>Wing IT</h3>
								<p>Wing IT! Is a two-player local coop game in which two birds try to hone the ball to the other side and thus gaining points. 
									The game was created in unity as a part of course work where we had to create two complete games ourselves during the semester.

								<h3>Caption Hook</h3>
								<p>Caption Hook is 2D jump & run made with the unity game engine. The player traverses’ various level by only using the ability of a hook shot.
									 Each level increases in difficulty and represents a different era of the internet. 
									 This game was part of a group assignment for the course “advanced game programming”. 
									 The only direction and constraint given was that we had to create a physics game.

								<h3>Number classification Neural Network 
								</h3>
								<p>In the fifth semester I selected a machine learning course. In preparation I decided to implement a neural network from scratch in my spare time
									 by only using python and the NumPy library for the required matrix multiplication. 
									 I used the MNIST dataset for training and after training the network boasts an accuracy of 97% for the test set.

								<h3>Trading Game WIP</h3>
								<p>Trading Game is a strategy game which plays on a 3D hex grid map. In this game the player controls a trading caravan and can travel between various towns 
									to buy and sell goods and generate profit by utilizing the price fluctuations between different regions to their advantage. 
									I am developing this game in my spare time when I don’t have complete university  assignments. </p>
