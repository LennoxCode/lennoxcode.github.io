						<h2>Motivation</h2>
						<p>
							The second game we created during the 'Game Engines' university course was intended to be a 3D game. We early on decided to set the game in the same universe as Wing IT! due to our collective appreciation for the adorable bird art style crafted by our group's art department. Proposing a tower defense game, I believed it offered an excellent fit for our group project, allowing each team member to design and implement their unique tower, if the underlying abstraction is well-constructed. Personally intrigued by strategy games, I sought to challenge myself by creating one. Ultimately, we aimed to introduce a creative twist to the original game's narrative by portraying the balls as antagonists attacking the birds.

						<h2>My Contribution</h2>
						<p>
							I played a key role in implementing crucial gameplay mechanics for our tower defense project, focusing on tasks such as enemy pathfinding, turret targeting, attack patterns, the build system, interface design, upgrade features, and tooltips. Given my extensive experience in the Unity game engine, particularly in managing core gameplay elements, I assumed the primary programming role. Simultaneously, my team members dedicated their efforts to crafting detailed artwork and 3D models for the turrets, recognizing the intricate nature of this task and the additional time it requires. This strategic division of labor ensured that each team member could contribute effectively to the project based on their strengths and expertise.

						<h2>Implementation</h2>
						<p>
							I implemented the building system by distributing cubes with colliders, utilizing onClick events to recognize player interaction. The build class manages turret prefabs and the selected turret. When an object is clicked, a turret is selected, and if the player has sufficient funds, a turret prefab is instantiated on top of the cube.
							<br>
							<br>
							Enemy spawning is handled by a Spawner class using nested coroutines for interval-based waves. I opted for nested functions to support different enemies in a single wave. I introduced a struct for a spawning scheme, serialized for easy editing in the editor, holding references to enemy prefabs and round parameters. Interpolating the enemy count based on round progression allows for easy adjustment of the difficulty curve or addition of new enemies.
							<br>
							<br>
							The enemy AI follows predefined waypoints, and upon reaching the last waypoint, one life is deducted. Defeating an enemy before reaching the endpoint results in a monetary reward. This functionality is implemented utilizing an event-driven architecture that triggers the related event, adding money in the player class.
							<br>
							<br>
							Money can be used to hire new birds or upgrade existing ones. Each bird offers two upgrade paths, providing players with options to further customize their defenses. A tooltip system activates when the cursor hovers over an interface element, offering detailed information. The tooltip system was implemented with a singleton class and an event class, making it easily integrable with interface elements requiring tooltips
							<br>
							<br>
							The targeting logic of the turrets iterates through enemies, selecting the closest one in range, and bullet instantiation manages damage on impact. Turret attack patterns rely on if statements based on predefined names, a less scalable solution. For future projects, I would implement the command design pattern, encapsulating attack logic in an AttackPattern class. This enhances flexibility, simplifies pattern changes, and supports future extensions.
