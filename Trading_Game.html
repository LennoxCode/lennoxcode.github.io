						<h2>Motivation</h2>
						<p>Because I very much enjoy game making especially with unity, I wanted to start a project myself to work on when 
							I don’t have much to for university or during the semester break. 
							I decided that I wanted to create a strategy game which involves trading because 
							I enjoy this type of game myself and can imagine how one should play. 
						</p>

						<h2>My Contribution</h2>
						<p>
							Because this is my own projects everything is done by me. 
							the 3D models are also done by me but are mostly placeholder right now as I plan to update them later with better textures
						</p>

						<h2>Implementation</h2>
						<p>
							For the overworld map I used the unity tilemap. Normally this module is intended to combine sprites – so it is more of a graphical component.
							However, with some setup tricks I could use to instantiate prefabs. 
							I created multiple hex tiles with different objects on them to represent different tiles.
							Additionally, I also used scriptable objects to assign properties like movement cost to these tiles.
							to make them clickable I once again utilized the onClick function. A big problem I saw when using the tilemap was the fact,
							that the unity tilemap does not provide API functions to retrieve tiles and their object from a specific coordinate.
							I decided to build a custom grid class which saves every tile in the beginning at provides functions to retrieve tiles from specific coordinates. 
							To enable the player to move to tiles which don’t neighbor the current tile 
							I implemented pathfinding by implementing the A* start algorithm which is widely used in gaming.
							To represent the different trade wares, I once again used scriptable objects to determine their base price, 
							and if they can be used as food for the caravan.
							Each city has an inventory with certain goods in stock and local price differences between city
							(a city which produces potatoes is going to offer them much cheaper).  
							The trading menu is implemented with layout elements to display the different wares and resize the containers accordingly.
							This interface is displayed can be accessed by another menu which is displayed as soon as the player enters a city which emits an event. 
							I once again relied heavily on events for this project so far as they have proven useful in a lot of cases. 
							I even created a dedicated globally accessible event bus function to resolve the dependencies for subscription easily.
							The game is also in real time and constantly advances time if the player is moving. To achieve this,
							I created a time class which also rotates the light source suggest a day and night rhythm.
							These are main mechanics I was able to implement so far, and I am excited to continue working on this project when university break starts, 
							and I don’t have to work on other assignments anymore.
