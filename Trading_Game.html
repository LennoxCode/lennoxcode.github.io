							<h1>Trading Game</h1>

						<h2>Motivation</h2>
						<p>
							I thoroughly enjoy game development, particularly with Unity. To occupy my time during breaks or when coursework is light, I've started a personal projectâ€”a strategy game with a focus on trading. This game will involve traversing a strategic map, buying and selling goods that vary in price based on location to turn a profit. I'm drawn to this genre due to my personal interest in strategic management games, and I was also determined to incorporate a procedural map generation algorithm to increase variety, a topic that greatly intrigues me.

						<h2>My Contribution</h2>
						<p>
							As this is a personal project, I am responsible for all aspects, including the creation of 3D models. Currently, the 3D models serve as placeholders, and I intend to update them with improved textures in subsequent iterations.

						<h2>Implementation</h2>
						<p>
							For the overworld map, I employed the Unity Tilemap module, primarily designed for combining sprites, and creatively configured it to instantiate prefabs. Using multiple hex tiles with distinct objects, each representing different tiles, I utilized Scriptable Objects to assign properties such as movement cost and the produced ressources. interactivity was achieved through the onClick function and events.
							<br>
							<br>
							One notable challenge arose with the Unity Tilemap's lack of API functions for retrieving tiles and their objects from specific coordinates. To address this, I crafted a custom grid class during the initial phase, storing every tile and providing functions for coordinate-based retrieval.
							<br>
							<br>
							Pathfinding was implemented using the A* algorithm to enable player movement to non-neighboring tiles and find the shortest possible path. To represent various trade wares, Scriptable Objects were once again employed for defining base prices and determining whether they can serve as food for the caravan. I prefer using Scriptable Objects to separate data from functionality, as they facilitate the easy creation of new trading objects.
							<br>
							<br>
							Each city offers an inventory with specific goods and local price variations, adding strategic depth to the trading system. The inventory is serializable, allowing for adjustments to price variations in the Unity editor. The trading menu, implemented through layout elements, ensures correct scaling by adjusting container sizes based on the number of wares offered. This interface is accessed through another menu triggered by a city entry event.
							<br>
							<br>
							The implementation heavily leans on events enhancing code scalability and simplifying the resolution of dependencies. A dedicated globally accessible event bus class, utilizing the singleton pattern, facilitates easy subscription handling. The game operates in real-time, advancing time continuously as the player moves. To achieve this, a time class was created, incorporating a day-and-night rhythm indicated by a rotating light source.
							<br>
							<br>
							These are the primary mechanics implemented thus far, and I eagerly anticipate developing it further in the future.
