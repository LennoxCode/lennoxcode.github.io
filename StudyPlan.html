						<h2>Motivation</h2>
						<p>During the fourth semester of my study, it is mandatory to do a practical project. It Counts three times as much as a normal course. 
							Students can select one of several projects which change each semester and are assigned to a professor to offer guidance and feedback. 
							I selected the project “better course selection” because I got screwed over by the system in this semester myself. 
							We got a lot of freedom in how to approach this project just like one would in the real world when working in a company. 
							After a long time of theory crafting, we settled for two main pillars – implementing a better algorithm when distributing the courses 
							by allowing prioritization and better usability by introducing drag & drop and making information easily available through modal windows.

						<h2>My Contribution</h2>
						<p>I did a lot of the heavy lifting for this project. During the initial planning stage, I brought up a lot of ideas like the priority system, 
							the ability for students to select the maximum of courses they want to end up with to limit the possibility that some people is assigned more courses than they want.  
							In addition, I also implemented the course selection model for the backend, did the first implementation of the front-end interface for the selection, 
							added a site for teachers to see wo is in their course, and added a survey model to easily decipher why people picked certain courses. Lastly,
							 I implemented the course assignment algorithm in collaboration with another team member by peer programming.

						<h2>Implementation</h2>
						<p>We implemented our project by using the MEVN tech stack which utilizes Vue for the front-end, express and NodeJS for the back-end, and MongoDB for the database. 
							Vue was the perfect fit because it provided global state and thus reactivity which is very important for a web app which requires drag & drop and thus a constant mutation of data.
							 In addition, Vue is also easier to learn compared to React which was important because most of our group did not have much experience with JavaScript.
							  The course selection menu utilizes several linked components which makes reusing them very simple. This was important because each priority row is an independent component. 
							  If a course is dragged into a priority row another one is automatically instantiated. 
							  This has the additional benefit of making the priority of each course easily distinguishable and saving the changes to the database. 
							  The distribution algorithm was realized by utilizing the fact that each JavaScript object is also a dictionary
							   by creating an object which contains each course as a key and having each priority from one to six as another key inside this object 
							   and saving each person with their priority to their respective rank in each course. Afterwards each one is shuffled and sorted by priority 
							   and only the students which the course can contain remain. 
							   Afterwards a loop removes people from courses with the lowest priority if they have too many courses and redistributes students until saturation is reached.
