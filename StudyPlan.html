						<h2>Motivation</h2>
						<p>
							In the fourth semester, each student participates in a mandatory team project comprising five to seven members, with the objective of collaboratively developing a functional application. Students choose from a selection of diverse projects, subject to change each semester, and are assigned a dedicated professor to provide guidance and feedback. I elected to contribute to the 'Better Course Selection' project, aiming to enhance the software system responsible for assigning students to courses, prompted by personal challenges encountered within the system. The project provided a substantial degree of autonomy, closely aligning with real-world scenarios. Following extensive research into the current system's challenges, our team focused on two key areas of improvement: refining the course distribution algorithm through a priority system, and enhancing usability through features such as drag-and-drop functionality and user-friendly modal windows

						<h2>My Contribution</h2>
						<p>
							I played a pivotal role in shaping the project from its inception. During the initial planning phase, I introduced innovative concepts, such as the priority system and the ability for students to set the maximum number of courses, ensuring a more tailored assignment process. Taking charge of the backend, I implemented the course selection model, while also spearheading the initial development of the front-end interface. Additionally, I designed a user-friendly site for teachers to effortlessly access their course information and integrated a survey model to gather insights into students' course preferences. In a collaborative effort, I co-implemented the course assignment algorithm through peer programming, ensuring a robust and efficient solution.The final algorithm significantly improved student satisfaction, achieving an impressive 82% approval in the initial test run. Additionally, it streamlined course assignments, reducing processing time from four weeks to just one. This success led to its adoption for the subsequent semester course assignments.

						<h2>Implementation</h2>
						<p>We implemented our project using the MEVN tech stack, leveraging Vue for the front-end, Express and NodeJS for the back-end, and MongoDB for the database. Vue was chosen for its suitability in managing global state, crucial for the reactivity required in a web app with drag & drop functionality. Vue's simplicity was key, especially considering our team's limited experience with JavaScript, making it more accessible than React.

							The course selection menu efficiently employs linked components, facilitating easy reuse. Each priority row is an independent component, ensuring simple instantiation when a course is dragged. This design not only distinguishes the priority of each course but also enables seamless data mutation and storage.
							<br>
							<br>
							Several MongoDB data models represent our application's data, with the central model being the 'course selection,' where each student has precisely one entry. This model employs key-value pairs, resembling a dictionary, to indicate the selected course and its priority. Users have the flexibility to specify the number of courses they wish to be assigned, preventing potential course access blockages if they already have sufficient courses. The data's validity is dynamically updated with each user modification, and the data's integrity is verified in the backend to ensure consistency.
							<br>
							<br>
							The distribution algorithm operates by utilizing JavaScript objects as dictionaries. Each course serves as a key, with priorities (ranging from one to six) nested within. Simultaneously, each person is associated with their priority in each course. The algorithm then involves shuffling, sorting, and selectively removing individuals based on course capacity. This iterative process continues until course saturation is reached, ensuring a balanced and optimal distribution of students across courses. Utilizing simple data structure operations, such as shuffling and sorting, the algorithm exhibited efficient performance, completing in less than a minute. While further optimizations may be necessary for larger deployments, we prioritized simplicity given the limited number of students at our university
