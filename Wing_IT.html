						<h2>Motivation</h2>
						<p>
							In my fourth semester, I enrolled in the 'Game Engines' course, where the primary objective was to develop two Unity gamesâ€”a 2D and a 3D game. After extensive discussions, our team decided on creating a physics-based game with multiplayer functionality. Our goal was to pay homage to 'Blobby Volley,' a game with nostalgic significance from my childhood, while infusing it with our unique aesthetic. The development of a 2D game also provided an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the Unity physics engine.

						<h2>My Contribution</h2>
						<p>
							As the sole member in our group with prior Unity experience, I undertook the responsibility of laying the foundation for my team to build upon. I commenced by implementing the controls and jump physics, fine-tuning them to achieve an optimal game feel. Subsequently, I developed the logic for the ball, scoring mechanisms, and associated interface elements. Finally, I incorporated menus, sound effects, and an indicator to track the ball's location when it leaves the camera bounds.

						<h2>Implementation</h2>
						<p>
							Implementing jumping controls proved to be a seamless process, given the robust built-in physics system provided by Unity. However, adjusting the physics to achieve a less 'floaty' game feel still proved challenging. I accomplished this by increasing gravity when falling, applying jump force as an impulse, and varying the force based on the duration of the button press.
							<br>
							<br>
							For player controls, I utilized the Unity Input System, enhancing flexibility for button reassignment and simplifying the transition between keyboard and controller for the second player. The physics for the ball included a highly bouncy physics material. Upon touching a player's collider, a force away from the player was added to the ball. If the ball hit an object tagged as 'ground,' the opposing player earned a point. After dropping the ball, it respawned on the losing player's side, giving them the advantage of the first move. I employed a coroutine with a method callback to ensure the ball respawned at the chosen position after 1.5 seconds, allowing the player to reposition.
							<br>
							<br>
							The menu was implemented using the Unity UI Toolkit, integrated with event functions for button presses. Music and sound were managed through an AudioManager class utilizing the singleton pattern for global access. While I typically avoid this pattern due to potential issues with global mutable state, it suited the needs of this small-scale game.
