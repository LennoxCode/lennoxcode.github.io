						<h2>Motivation</h2>
						<p>In my fourth semester I selected a course called game engines. The main task was to program to games in unity – one 2D game and one 3D game.  
							After some discussion we quickly settled on a physics game and the ability for two players to play the game. The goal was to pay homage to “Blobby Volley” 
							which I used to play a lot as a kid with our own aesthetic. 
						</p>

						<h2>My Contribution</h2>
						<p>I was the only person in our group who had prior unity experience, so I wanted to lay the foundation for my group members to expand. 
							I started by implementing the controls and jump physics and adjusted them to have a nice game feeling. 
							Afterwards I implemented the logic for the ball, scoring and the accompanying interface elements. 
							Lastly, I also added menus, sound and an indicator see where the ball is when it flies out of camera bounds.
						</p>

						<h2>Implementation</h2>
						<p>The implementation for the jumping controls was straight forward because unity provides a comprehensive built-in physics system. 
							I added a rigid body and colliders to the playable characters. The more difficult part was adjusting these physics to give a less “floaty” game feel. 
							I accomplished this by increasing the gravity when falling, applying the jump force as an impulse, 
							and adding variety in the force in relation to how long the button was pressed. 
							For the player controls I used the player control package because it added a lot of flexibility for reassigning buttons 
							and made swapping between keyboard and controller for the second player very easy.
							I implemented the physics for the ball, with a physics material with a lot of bounciness.
							In addition, if the ball touches the collider of a player force away from the player is added to the ball. 
							If the ball touches something with the tag “ground” the opposite player is awarded a point. After the ball is dropped the ball respawns on the losing players side to give the advantage of the first move. I used a coroutine which uses a method callback to make the ball respawn at the selected position after 1.5 seconds so the player can reposition.
							To implement the menu, I used the unity UI toolkit in conjunction with event functions if the buttons are pressed. 
							The music and sound are played with an audio manager class which uses a singleton pattern to provide global access. 
							Nowadays I try to avoid this patten because global mutable state can lead to a lot of problems, but it lends itself well to a small scale game like this.
