						<h2>Motivation</h2>
						<p>In the fifth semester I selected a machine learning module. Because I was curious and worried that the course would proof too difficult If I am unprepared, 
							I decided that I wanted to program my own neural network from scratch. I know that this could be much easier achieved using the TensorFlow library, 
							but I wanted to understand the theory behind machine learning and understand an intuition before using abstraction.
						</p>

						<h2>My Contribution</h2>
						<p>Because this was a sole project, I did everything myself and did not use any libraries outside of numpy. 
							theoretically I could program the required linear algebra myself but by using a hardware accelerated library the training is much faster.
						</p>

						<h2>Implementation</h2>
						<p>I used a book from the library to help me understand the underlying algorithms. 
							I started my implementation with a constructor which controls how many inputs, hidden and output-nodes the network has. 
							I decided to implement a network with only one hidden layer because more hidden layers would lead to possible problems like the vanishing gradient 
							and one hidden layer is enough for such as simple task. Otherwise, the constructor creates matrices with random values for the forward propagation. 
							Implementing the forward propagation is straight forward because it is only required to multiply the input matrix with the matrix for the hidden 
							and output layer and applying the activation function for each node (I used the sigmoid function).
							An activation function is essential to build a layered network because without a nonlinear function 
							the network would just be a linear combination of each node which would defeat the purpose.
							The last and most difficult part of the network implementation is the back propagation algorithm. 
							To train the network we define a so-called loss function which a lot of the time is just the mean square error. 
							The goal is to minimize this function which could be normally achieved by calculating the zero value of the second derivate however 
							a complex function with so many dimensions like a neural network is almost impossible to derive. Thus, 
							a gradient is used by partially deriving for each node in network and using the chain to rule to back propagate. 
							The weights are then subtracted by this gradient and the partially derivate is then propagated further back until the input nodes are reached. 
							This algorithm seemed intimidating at first for me but is much easier to implement than I thought 
							because it mostly utilizes mathematical rules I learned in high school. afterwards I tweaked the learning rate, 
							the number of hidden nodes, normalized the inputs and increased the amount of training iterations until the network was saturated.
